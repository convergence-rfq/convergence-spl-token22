This code defines two enums, `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and `AssetIdentifierDuplicate`, and provides conversion implementations for each to their respective counterparts in the `rfq::state` module, `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier`. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a workaround for a limitation in the `anchor_lang` library's IDL generation. When importing structs from external crates, `anchor_lang` does not generate IDL for those structs, which can cause issues when trying to use them in a program. To get around this limitation, this code defines duplicate enums that are identical to the ones in the `rfq::state` module, but with different names. It then provides conversion implementations for each duplicate enum to its corresponding enum in `rfq::state`. 

This code is likely used in the larger Convergence Program Library project to facilitate communication between different parts of the program that use structs from external crates. By defining duplicate enums and providing conversion implementations, this code allows the program to use these external structs without running into issues with IDL generation. 

Example usage of this code might look like:

```
use convergence_program_library::AuthoritySideDuplicate;
use rfq::state::AuthoritySide;

let taker_duplicate = AuthoritySideDuplicate::Taker;
let taker: AuthoritySide = taker_duplicate.into();
assert_eq!(taker, AuthoritySide::Taker);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `rfq` crate and how is it related to this code?
   - It is unclear what the `rfq` crate is and how it is related to this code. Further documentation or context is needed to understand its purpose.

2. Why is there a duplicate enum for `AuthoritySide` and `AssetIdentifier`?
   - The comment in the code suggests that the duplicate is required because anchor doesn't generate IDL for imported structs. A smart developer might want to know more about why this is the case and how it affects the use of these enums.

3. What is the overall purpose of this code and how does it fit into the Convergence Program Library?
   - Without additional context, it is difficult to understand the overall purpose of this code and how it fits into the Convergence Program Library. A smart developer might want to know more about the library's goals and how this code contributes to them.
