This code defines several enums and a struct that are used in the Convergence Program Library project. The first two enums, `AuthoritySideDuplicate` and `AssetIdentifierDuplicate`, are duplicates of enums from the `rfq` and `risk_engine` crates, respectively. These duplicates are necessary because the `anchor_lang` crate used in this project does not generate IDL for imported structs. The `From` trait is implemented for each duplicate enum to convert it to the corresponding enum from the imported crate.

The `ParsedLegData` struct contains three fields: `option_common_data`, `mint_address`, and `euro_meta_address`. `option_common_data` is a field of type `OptionCommonData` from the `risk_engine` crate, while `mint_address` and `euro_meta_address` are both of type `Pubkey` from the `anchor_lang` crate. The `SERIALIZED_SIZE` constant is defined for `ParsedLegData` as the sum of the serialized sizes of its fields plus 32 bytes for each `Pubkey` field.

Overall, this code provides necessary definitions for enums and a struct used in the Convergence Program Library project. These definitions allow for proper serialization and deserialization of data used in the project. For example, the `ParsedLegData` struct is used to represent parsed data for a leg of an option, including its common data, mint address, and euro meta address. This struct can be serialized and deserialized using the `AnchorSerialize` and `AnchorDeserialize` traits provided by the `anchor_lang` crate.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines several enums and a struct for use in the Convergence Program Library, specifically related to asset identifiers, authority sides, and parsed leg data.

2. Why is there a duplicate enum for AuthoritySide and AssetIdentifier?
- The duplicate enums are necessary because the IDL generator used by the library does not generate IDL for imported structs.

3. What is the significance of the ParsedLegData struct and its SERIALIZED_SIZE constant?
- The ParsedLegData struct contains information about an option's common data, mint address, and euro meta address. The SERIALIZED_SIZE constant is used to determine the size of the serialized struct.
