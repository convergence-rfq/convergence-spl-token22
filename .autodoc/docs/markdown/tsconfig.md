This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies that the configuration should extend another configuration file located at `./tsconfig.build.json`. This allows for the reuse of common configuration options across multiple files. 

The `compilerOptions` object specifies options for the TypeScript compiler. In this case, it sets the `rootDir` option to `.` which means that the root directory for the TypeScript source files is the current directory. 

The `include` array specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process. In this case, it includes the `tests` directory. This means that any TypeScript files located in the `tests` directory will be compiled along with the other source files. 

This configuration file is an important part of the Convergence Program Library project as it ensures that the TypeScript compiler is configured correctly for the project. It allows for the reuse of common configuration options and ensures that all necessary files are included in the compilation process. 

Here is an example of how this configuration file may be used in the larger project:

```
// tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.build.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": ".",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["src", "tests"]
}
```

In this example, the `tsconfig.json` file extends the `tsconfig.build.json` file and adds additional options such as the `outDir` option which specifies the output directory for compiled files. The `include` array includes both the `src` and `tests` directories for compilation. This ensures that all necessary files are compiled and output to the correct directory.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "extends" property in the JSON object?
   - The "extends" property is used to inherit settings from another configuration file, in this case, "./tsconfig.build.json".

2. What is the significance of setting "rootDir" to "." in the "compilerOptions" property?
   - Setting "rootDir" to "." specifies that the root directory for input files is the current directory.

3. What is the purpose of including the "tests" directory in the "include" property?
   - Including the "tests" directory specifies that the TypeScript compiler should include files in that directory when compiling the project. This is likely for running automated tests.
